#Previous POW ASIC Resistant Algorithms
#SHA256   for Bitcoin
#Scrypt   for Litecoin
#Ethash   for Etherium
#X11      for Dash
#X16R     for Ravencoin
#Equihash for Zcash

#Approach
#approach is to use a sequence of hashing algorithms where the output of one
#becomes the input to the next.
#chaining more algorithms together adds difficulty in constructing an ASIC

#Previous POW Algorithms
#SHA256 for Bitcoin (Potential ASIC efficiency gain ~ 1000X)
#Scrypt for Litecoin (Potential ASIC efficiency gain ~ 1000X)
#Ethash for Etherium (Potential ASIC efficiency gain ~ 2X)
#X16R   for Ravecoin (Potential ASIC efficiency gain ~ 1000X)
#Equihas for Zcash (Potential ASIC efficiency gain ~ 100X)

#Proposed Algorithm Approach
#use a sequence of hashing algorithms where the output of onebecomes the input to the next
#The fixed order of hashing algorithms lends itself to the construction of ASICs
#While chaining more algorithms together adds difficulty in constructing an ASIC
#We can randomize ordering based on the hash of the previous block
